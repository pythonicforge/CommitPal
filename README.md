### How It Works
1. **Commit Message Generation**:
   - Parses the `git diff` output.
   - Uses an AI model (e.g., `gemma2-9b-it`) to generate a commit message based on a predefined template:
     ```
     <type>(<scope>): <short description>
     ```
   - Example:
     ```
     feat(cli): add support for auto-push flag
     ```

2. **Changelog Generation**:
   - Creates a changelog entry based on the `git diff` output.
   - Appends the entry to `changelogs/changelog.md`.

3. **Git Automation**:
   - Stages all changes (`git add .`).
   - Commits changes with the generated commit message.
   - Pushes changes to the remote repository.
