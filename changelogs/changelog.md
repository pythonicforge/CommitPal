What a delightful `git diff` output!

It appears that you've made changes to two files: `cli/shell.py` and `utils/services.py`. Here's a brief summary of the changes:

**cli/shell.py**

* In the `do_diff` method, the `parse_args` function is now called with an additional `style` parameter.
* The `generate_commit_message` function is called with an additional `style` parameter.

**utils/services.py**

* The `generate_commit_message` function now takes an additional `style` parameter with a default value of "default".
* The function's prompt has been updated to include the `style` parameter.
* The `parse_args` function now returns a tuple with an additional `style` value.
* The `style` value is extracted from the input `args` string using the `--style=` flag.

Overall, it seems like you've added support for a `--style` flag to customize the commit message generation process.
